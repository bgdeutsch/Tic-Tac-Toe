Weclome to Tic-Tac-Toe!

My name is Brian Deutsch, and I have built a simple and fun Tic-Tac-Toe Game!



Here are some basic rules of the game:

The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board.

User can decide to be X or O.  Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.

If the board is filled, and no player has made three in a row, the game ends in stalemate.
